mailcatcher Chef Cookbook
=========================

This cookbook installs mailcatcher.  Any mail sent to port 25, or any mail coming
from PHP will be caught by mailcatcher.

You can see the mail that is sent by this VM by visiting [http://your.vm:1080](http://your.vm:1080)

This is confirmed working on Debian.  For different Linux flavors, some of the paths
may be wrong.
